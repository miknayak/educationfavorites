                  <p>A business degree offers almost limitless possibilities because it will prepare you for success in a variety of business, government, and nonprofit organization settings. As one of the most popular college majors, there are many programs levels to choose from, including associate degrees, undergraduate degrees, certificates, graduate degrees, and doctoral degrees.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cont-box">
                  <h3>Associate Degree</h3>
                  <p>While most people who intent to pursue a career in business apply for an undergraduate degree, associate degrees are available.

                  <h3>Undergraduate Degree</h3>
                  <p>Associate degrees may provide a good foundation, but most business employers expect candidates to have an undergraduate degree. Most people who plan to pursue an extended career in business start with a bachelor’s degree in business or business administration.

Master’s degree recipients often make more money, advance faster, and are qualified for jobs that require advanced business concepts. While programs can be general or specialized, they usually consist of 30 to 60 credit hours of coursework and are completed by full-time students in two years.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cont-box">
