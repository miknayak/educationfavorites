                </figure>
                <p class="post-detail-cont">Paying for college can be a daunting task, but financial aid makes earning a degree significantly easier for people who can’t pay out of pocket. Loans can help you pay for any type of degree, whether it be an associate, undergraduate, graduate, or doctoral degree. In many cases, students are offered at least one student loan as part of their financial aid package. The money provided can help to pay for tuition, room, board, textbooks, and any other education-related expenses that might arise while enrolled. It’s important to realize, however, that the loan must be paid back over time.</p>

                <div class="cont-box">
                  <h3>Difference Between Student Loans, Scholarships, and Grants</h3>
                  <p>Students loans are drastically different from scholarships and grants. Scholarships and grants are generally considered “gift aids,” as recipients are not responsible for paying the provided amount back after graduation. Loans, on the other hand, must be repaid according to the terms and conditions agreed upon at signing. </p>
                  <p class="post-detail-cont">It’s worth noting, however, that loans generally come with few other stipulations. Scholarships are merit-based, while grants are needs-based; in both cases it’s possible not to qualify for enough funds to cover your educational expenses. Student loans can supplement the difference and make it possible for you to get the education you deserve.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cont-box">
                  <h3>Student Loan Types</h3>
                  <p>There are two primary types of student loans. Loans that are funded by the federal government are called federal student loans. Other loans are offered through private sources, like banks and financial institutions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cont-box">
                  <h3>Federal Student Loans</h3>
                  <p>Federal student loans are offered through the United States government. Because of this, they generally have lower interest rates and flexible repayment options. There are two federal loan programs: the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program and the Federal Perkins Loan Program.</p>
                  <p class="post-detail-cont">The Federal Perkins Loan Program is only available to undergraduate and graduate students with exceptional financial need. These are school-based loans and the school will be the official lender. Undergraduates can receive loans up to $5,500 per year and graduate students can receive up to $8,000 per year. The actual loan amount depends on several factors, including need, availability of funds, and the amount of other aid already secured.</p>
                  <p class="post-detail-cont">As the larger of the two loan programs, the Direct Loan Program offers students four different financing options. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="clearfix">
                  <ul class="bullet-list strong-ui-li">
                    <li><strong>Direct Subsidized Loan –</strong> Available to undergraduate students demonstrating financial need.</li>
                    <li><strong>Direct Unsubsidized Loan –</strong> Available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students who don’t demonstrate enough financial need.</li>
                    <li><strong>Direct PLUS Loan –</strong> Available to graduate, professional students, and parents of undergraduates to cover education expenses not covered by other aid.</li>
                    <li><strong>Direct Consolidation Loan –</strong> Available to loan holders who want to combine all of their federal student loans into a single loan.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="cont-box">
                  <p>Undergraduate students are eligible for $5,500 to $12,500 in Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Graduate students, on the other hand, may qualify for up to $20,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loans each year. The exact loan amount is also dependent on the number of years in college. This type of loan is processed through the United States Department of Education, which is the official lender.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cont-box">
                  <h3>Private Loans</h3>
                  <p>When scholarships, grants, and federal loans aren’t enough to cover your educational expenses, a private loan may be the best answer. These credit-based loans are not associated with the government and generally require less time to apply. Overall, they are more like traditional consumer loans, but include in-school deferment, hardship deferment options, and no pre-payment penalties.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cont-box">
                  <h3>How to Apply</h3>
                  <p>To qualify for a federal student loan, you must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Your loan offers will be included in the financial aid package sent to you by your chosen institution upon admittance. Private loans, however, must be processed through the associated organization or bank. </p>
